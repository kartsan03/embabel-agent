/**
 * Declares that a property is a rating question in the decision spec read from its type.
 * <p>
 * The property type is an enum with at least two constants. Each constant is a level, lowest
 * first in declaration order. The level id is the constant's serialized form under the mapper.
 * A constant's description comes from {@link Described}, or is the level id when the constant
 * has none.
 * <p>
 * The question name is the Jackson property name. Put the annotation on a record component, or
 * on the field, getter, setter or creator parameter of a Jackson property. Jackson merges these
 * members into one property, so the annotation may appear on several of them with the same
 * {@code asking} text.
